### Hi there 👋

I'm Advait. I'm a technologist :electron: , designer ✏️ , educator 🎒 , and game developer 🎮 currently based out of London, UK 󠁧󠁢󠁥:england: .   
I live on the intersection of the four - creating artist-facing tools, games, weird things with ordinary languages, and digital artworks in physical spaces.    
I am keenly interested in combining the physical and the digital to create computing systems that work better and feel more natural.     
And when my code works too well or not at all, I am keenly interested in making things funky. :shipit:

#### I specialise in:
- C/C++ for Desktop Applications 💻
- Physical Computing with Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, and other fun boards and components 🔌
- Unity/Unreal Game Development  :goberserk:
- All kinds of ML work using TensorFlow 🤖🎰

#### I can also kinda do:
- Web Dev with Ract, 3JS, P5.js, etc. 🖥️🕸️

#### I'm currently working on: 
[TactiScape VR](https://github.com/AdvaitU/tactiscape-vr) - Scape is a tool that lets one sculpt landscapes in VR using their hands as if modelling with real clay. It was created as a part of a research project that attempted to evaluate the hypothesis “Pseudo-Tactility, following in the footsteps of true tactility, makes a computing system more tangible, intuitive, (and fun) for the user. You can find the research paper [here](https://github.com/AdvaitU/tactiscape-vr/blob/main/AdvaitUkidve-TactiScapeVR-ThesisThesis.pdf)

      
#### Some of the things I've done over the past year: 
- **[Fast Fiction NPC Creator](https://github.com/AdvaitU/fast-fiction-ae-dnd-npc-generator)** - A customisable Dungeons and Dragons NPC (Non-Player Character) creation tool for Dungeon Masters to use in a pinch when the party goes off-path. Want a new chaotic-evil high-elf sorcerer posing as a hermit, but without the trouble of writing the rest of their stats? Fast Fiction can fill them in, in an instant, using a Variational Auto Encoder and its rich latent space filled with well-thought human-made characters. And with a nice(ish) portrait to go with it!
- **[Endgame](https://github.com/AdvaitU/endgame)** - A post-post-apocalyptic fantasy game where you play as Harold the ball (using a spherical controller) in a quest against time to save a cryo-frozen angry Erik Ten Haag from his telephone box prison. Endgame was created in order to examine how the affordances of, and hence interactions with, alternative controllers shape play and create new navigational paradigms in video games. The game also offers commentary on capitalism and consumerism through surreal world-building.
- **[Pop Up Smash Pro](https://github.com/AdvaitU/pop-up-smash-pro)** - A gallery piece about punching annoying notifications right in their cross marks before your screen and thus your mental space fills up. Inspired by the crippling anxiety that notifications on my own phone bring, Pop Up Smash Pro allows attendees to punch surreal Windows 95 themed notifications one after the other in an battle against time, all while a sense of inevitable defeat looms. It was created for and first exhibited at The Hub, Eagle Wharf (2023).
