### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Advait. I'm a technologist, designer, educator, and game developer currently based out of London, UK.   
I live on the intersection of the three, creating artist-facing tools, games, weird things with ordinary languages, and digital artworks in physical spaces.    
I am keenly interested in combining the physical and the digital to create computing systems that work better and feel more natural.     
And when my code works too well or not at all, I am keenly interested in making things funky. 

#### I specialise in:
- C/C++ for Desktop Applications
- Physical Computing with Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, and other fun boards and components.
- Unity/Unreal Game Development
- All kinds of ML work using TensorFlow

#### I can also kinda do:
- Web Dev with Ract, 3JS, P5.js, etc.
  
#### I'm currently working on: 
[TactiScape VR]() - 
#### Some of the things I've done over the past year: Scape is a tool that lets one sculpt landscapes in VR using their hands as if (hopefully) modelling with real clay. It was created as a part of a research project that attempted to evaluate the hypothesis â€œPseudo-Tactility (faking it), following in the footsteps of true tactility (actually touching things), makes a computing system more tangible, intuitive, (and fun) for the user. You can find the research paper [here](https://github.com/AdvaitU/tactiscape-vr/blob/main/AdvaitUkidve-TactiScapeVR-ThesisThesis.pdf)
