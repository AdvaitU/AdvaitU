### Hi there 👋

I'm Advait. I'm a technologist, designer, educator, and game developer currently based out of London, UK.   
I live on the intersection of the four - creating artist-facing tools, board games and video games, weird things with ordinary languages, and digital artworks in physical spaces.
I am keenly interested in combining the physical and the digital to create computing systems that work better and feel more natural.     
And when my code works too well or not at all, I am keenly interested in making things funky. :shipit:

- Physical Computing with Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, and other fun boards and components 🔌
- Unity/Unreal Game Development  :goberserk:
- All kinds of ML work using TensorFlow 🤖🎰
